         <p>Traditionally a Roux is made from flour and fat, but who can afford all those extra calories.
             A roux lends taste and texture to many Cajun and Creole dishes.</p>
        <p>Here's a roux, made by simply browning the flour, that adds the same flavor as fat-based roux. 
        <p> It's not hard to make, but like a traditional roux, it does require your full attention-so. 
         No phone calls or interruptions when making it! </p> 
         <p>If stored in a tightly covered container, roux flour will keep for 2 to 3 months.</p> 
         <p>AMOUNT/MEASURE INGREDIENT </p>
         <p>4 cups all-purpose flour </p>
         <p>Place the flour in a large skillet over high heat; with a wire whisk stir constantly for 25 minutes, or until the flour turns the color of light brown sugar. If the flour begins to darken too fast, remove the skillet from the heat and stir to allow flour to cool and color evenly before putting it back on a lower heat setting. If the flour burns, throw it away and try again. Remove from the heat and continue stirring until the flour is completely cooled. 
         <p>Sift the flour into a container, and store, covered, until needed. </p>

      <h3>Baked Stuffed Artichokes</h3>
      <p>PREP TIME 25 mins
        COOK TIME 60 mins
        TOTAL TIME 85 mins
        SERVINGS 4 servings
        Ingredients
        •	6 slices white bread
        •	1 teaspoon lemon zest
        •	1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
        •	8 cloves garlic, divided
        •	1/2 cup chopped parsley
        •	1 teaspoon fresh oregano, minced
        •	1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided
        •	1/8 teaspoon Mark’s creole seasoning
        •	2 large globe artichokes
        •	4 slices lemon, divided
        •	1 bay leaf
        •	Salt, optional
        Method
        1.	Make fresh breadcrumbs:
        Cut off the crust from 6 slices of bread. Chop the centers and put into a food processor. Pulse until you have coarse breadcrumbs. You should have about 3 cups.
        2.	Make the stuffing:
        In a large bowl, stir together the breadcrumbs, lemon zest, Parmesan cheese, minced garlic (from 6 of the garlic cloves, reserving the remaining 2 cloves), chopped parsley, minced oregano, 1/2 cup olive oil, and black pepper. Set aside.
        
        3.	Prep the artichokes:
        Cut off the stem, leaving 1/2 inch from the bottom row of leaves. Using kitchen scissors, cut off 1/2 inch of the tips of all of the artichoke leaves.
        
        
        Cut 1 inch from the top of the artichoke. (It helps to use a serrated knife like a bread knife for this.)
        Take a slice of lemon and rub over the cut edges of the artichokes to keep them from turning brown.
        4.	Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
        5.	Stuff the artichokes:
        Use your finger to gently pull open the center leaves of the artichokes. Pull out the inner tender yellow artichoke leaves. Use a small metal spoon to scrape and scoop out all of the inner fuzzy choke.
        
        
        Place artichokes on a sheet pan (to catch the breadcrumbs) and start stuffing the artichoke with your stuffing mix. Put some stuffing mix between each large leaf and the artichoke, as well as a generous amount in the center.
        6.	Bake the artichokes:
        Put about 1 inch of boiling water in the bottom of a Dutch oven that will snugly hold the artichokes. Add 2 slices of lemon, a bay leaf, the 2 remaining garlic cloves, halved, to the water.
        Place the artichokes sitting upright in the water. Drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
        
        Cover the pot tightly with a lid. (Remember to cover the dish or this method will not work!)
        Bake for 1 hour at 375°F (190°C), or until a knife easily penetrates the heart of the artichoke or you can easily remove one of the outer petals. (Depending on the size of the artichoke baking time can vary from 50 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes or longer.)
        Remove the cover and broil for a minute or so, enough to get some browning on the top of the stuffing.
        Remove artichokes to a serving dish to serve. The Parmesan adds a good amount of saltiness, but if you prefer more salt, add more to taste.
